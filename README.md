# Turret Repo

This repo is for a small project I am working on:

The aim is to build and program a fully operational sentry turret/gun (It's a NERF gun!!!)

This is a huge WIP but there will be many improvements to come.

# Update as of 12/12/23:

Turret_Main_MK2 has been added


# Update as of 16/2/24

I have now made the repository public, everything (commits, branches ect.) is a mess, apologies.
